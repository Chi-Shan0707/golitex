Litex is an intuitive yet powerful formal language. At its core, it is a tool that enables you to express reasoning following Litex's defined rules, while automatically verifying the correctness of your reasoning. This makes it particularly valuable for validating mathematical proofs and other rule-based systems. Unlike other formal languages that even experienced mathematicians find challenging to use, Litex recognizes that reasoning is an innate human capability - even a 5-year-old possesses basic reasoning instincts. Our mission is to make formal reasoning accessible to everyone. In essence, Litex represents an ambitious attempt to scale reasoning capabilities in the AI age.

**Scaling means more people involved:** Given that Litex is orders of magnitude more concise than other formal languages, we anticipate orders of magnitude more people joining the Litex community, potentially even establishing GitHub-style collaborative development for formalized reasoning.

**Scaling means more mathematical discovery:** Auto-formalization is emerging as a promising approach for AI to learn general-purpose reasoning. Rather than having a mathematician spend a day solving a single problem, it's more efficient to enable a large model to solve 10,000 problems in one second. Litex provides the ideal infrastructure for this paradigm shift.
