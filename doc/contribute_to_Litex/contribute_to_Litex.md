# Contribute to Litex

## Join Our Journey

Litex is an ambitious project with a clear vision: to create a simple, intuitive, and powerful formal language for mathematics. While we're in the early stages of development, we've already established a solid foundation that demonstrates the potential of this approach. Like a promising startup, we're building something that could fundamentally change how we think about and work with mathematical formalization.

## Why Contribute?

Litex represents a unique opportunity to be part of something groundbreaking. By contributing, you'll be:
- Shaping the future of mathematical formalization
- Working on a project that bridges the gap between traditional mathematics and modern computing
- Helping create tools that could revolutionize how AI systems understand and work with mathematics
- Building a community that values simplicity and intuition in mathematical expression
