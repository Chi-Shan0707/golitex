# Litex: A Minimalist Proof Assistant

## About

_That language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought._

_â€“- George Boole_

**LiTeX is a proof assistant (formal language) designed for everyone, not just experts. Since even children grasp math naturally, a formal language design should exist that's easily understood and used by anyone. The goal of Litex is to invent such a language. The implementation approach leverages a profound understanding of the commonalities and distinctions between programming and mathematics.**

**Many AI experts view formal language as crucial for reasoning. Traditional proof assistants lack the fluidity and ease needed to scale formal proofs, while Litex handles the growing complexity of modern mathematics effectively through its well-designed syntax.**

**Litex has significant potential to impact both mathematics and AI: for mathematics, it simplifies complex abstractions and proof construction, reducing paper review time to 0 since Litex verifies correctness, enabling trust in strangers' work and fostering large-scale collaboration like a "Github of Math." For AI, it enhances formal reasoning and proof automation capabilities, which is essential for reinforcement stage of training. Because Litex is simple, it will attract many users, leading to an increase in the formal datasets that are currently scarce in the AI field.**
