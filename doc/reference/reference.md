## Words from the Inventor

_The best way to predict the future is to invent it._

_-- Alan Kay_

I, Jiachen Shen, a hacker and a math enthusiast. I majored in math and self-taught programming. Also, I am a programming language geek. I have been working on Litex since 2024, and I am still working on it. I really like designing and engineering new languages.

A good art is what makes its creator happy and makes its users find it useful.[^1] I hope Litex can be a good art for both me and its users.

In the AI age, we are facing a paradigm shift from data-driven learning to formal-language-driven reinforcement learning. Traditional formal languages are too complex and too far removed from the expression habits of everyday mathematics. Litex is here to make formal language more accessible to everyone.

**NOTICE: Litex is still under active development. Contribution and early adoption is welcome!**

## Design Principles of Litex

_That language is an instrument of Human reason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted._
