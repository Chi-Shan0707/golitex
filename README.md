## Litex: The Simplest Formal Language

Visit [Tutorial](https://litexlang.org/doc/Tutorial/Introduction) to learn how to use Litex and try some examples.

Visit [Start](https://litexlang.org/doc/Start) to start using Litex (online, locally, in Python, in Jupyter Notebook, etc.).

Litex is an intuitive and scalable formal language for coding reasoning. It ensures every step is correct, and can be learned by anyone in 1–2 hours, even without math or programming background.

Formal language turns writing math into writing code, enabling automation, collaboration, and standardization. With AI generating reasoning and Litex verifying it, automated reasoning becomes a reality.

Traditional formal languages are too complex. Litex lowers the barrier by 10x, making formalization as easy and fast as natural writing. This benefits both AI research and the math community.
