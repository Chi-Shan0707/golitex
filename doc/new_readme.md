## Litex: the simplest formal language

_Mathematics is the language with which God wrote the universe._

_-- Galileo Galilei_

_The best way to predict the future is to invent it._

_-- Alan Kay_

Litex is a simple and easy-to-learn formal language. It makes formal reasoning as natural as writing in natural language. Thanks to its innovative design, even 10-year-olds can learn Litex easily. This gives it a dimensional advantage over existing formal languages. In the foreseeable future, Litex is going to reduce the time ratio between formalizing a proof and writing it in natural language from 10:1 to 1:1. 

Litex is designed to be a domain language as close as daily mathematical writing as possible. The key insight of Litex is: mathematical verification (or reasoning in general) is nothing but a special kind of **match and substitution** problem, similar to "ctrl+f (or cmd+f)" in your browser. By deliberately sacrificing Turing completeness, Litex can have a much cleaner and intuitive syntax and semantics, focused on and only on mathematical verification. This is very different from existing formal languages, such as Lean, which are Turing complete programming languages (just like Python, Go, C, etc), and is fundamentally different from the nature of mathematics .
