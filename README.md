## Litex: The Simplest Formal Language

**Litex is an intuitive and scalable formal language for coding your reasoning. It ensures all steps of your reasoning are correct. We assume a man without any math or programming background can start using Litex after 1-2 hours of learning.**

**Formal language makes the process of writing math into a process of writing code. This is a very powerful idea, because code means automation without human intervention, large-scale collaboration, standardization, etc. The tedious process of verifying a piece of reasoning (e.g. a proof of a mathematical theorem) is now automated.**

**Computers have revolutionized how we calculate. With the combined power of AI (generate unverified reasoning automatically) and formal language (verify reasoning automatically), we are now entering a new era of automated reasoning. AI researchers are now using formal languages to build better and safer models.**

**However, traditional formal languages are too complex for non-technical users. AI researchers, mathematicians are calling for a new formal language to boost their job. Fundamentally, since a 10-year-old can reason about basic math by following specific rules, and using a formal language is nothing more than using such set of rules to reason, everyone should be able to learn formal language easily.**

**If you have the above problems, Litex is the perfect language for you. It is such a simple language that lowers the bar and cost of using formal language by 10 times. This simplicity and accessibility of Litex reduces the time ratio, between formalizing a proof and writing it in natural language, from 10:1 to 1:1. That is why constructing Litex codebase is 10x cheaper and has a 10x lower entrance barrier than traditional formal languages. This is a blessing for both AI industry and math community.**

## Contact & Contribute to Litex

Hello, my friend, this is Jiachen Shen, creator of Litex. I welcome you to join the Litex community and grow with Litex together. Our work on Litex focuses on several key directions:

- **Dataset of Litex** – including the translation of short mathematical problems ranging from elementary school to undergraduate level. Advanced Dataset – covering IMO problems, elementary school/ middle school/ university textbooks, and mathematical research papers. With the dataset, Litex can be used as a tool for AI training and research.

- **Litex + AI** – this is closely tied to the dataset. Litex’s ultimate goal is to scale formal reasoning in the AI age, and embedding Litex into AI workflows is therefore an essential and intrinsic direction. It is believed that Litex can be used as a revolutionary tool for AI reasoning and trusty AI by lowering the cost and entrance barrier of formal reasoning by 10x.
