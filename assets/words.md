# Tutorial

Think this way: When you verify a piece of proof in your brain, what you are doing is nothing more than **matching** known facts with the facts you are now writing. Litex is a computer tool to automate this process and verify your reasoning for you. And in this way Litex helps you build new facts on top of the existing facts with 100% correctness.

**Technically, first-order logic, with its 8 core keywords (and, or, not, forall, exist, equal, if, then), forms the foundation of all mainstream mathematics. Litex builds on this foundation as a thin layer, implementing a "regular expression interpreter with customizable matching rules and math-friendly syntax sugar". Its simplicity means you can learn it with just common sense.**

However, You do not need to learn set thoery or first-order logic to use Litex. Just learn by using it! The inventor of Litex also only has a very basic knowledge of set thoery and first-order logic.

(For computer scientists: Litex code a read-only Turing machine instead of a Turing machine. That is why it is different from mainstream programming langauges.)

# Project Values

Simplicity over Complexity: Litex is simple for users to learn, use, cooperate, and extend. No more, no less in terms of features.

Pragmatism over Rigor: Litex is all about getting things done. It is not a proof of an idea, but a tool to help you do math.

For everyone, not just specialists: Because mathematics is for everyone, Litex should too. May everyone learn something from Litex and enjoy the process of doing math. :)
